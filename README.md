Mediacal Log Application Prototype

Problem:
- Many people have offline medical history, old forms/files...
- Many doctors offices still use print forms and keep data offline, or not shared on existing data networks

^ These lead to doctors being uninformed on conditions, making it difficult to find the right way to treat
Information that might be vital to the assessment of the patient might only exist offline

Give patients the ability to catlog this data with minimal work


Use Case:
- Patient uploads documents and adds title (optional)
- Application scrapes data from the form and digitizes it
- Application allows user to provide others (doctors/nurse) secure access to their files
